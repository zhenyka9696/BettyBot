alex говорит:Betty Botter bought some butter
But she said the butter’s bitter,
“If I put it in my batter
It will make my batter bitter,
But a bit of better butter
Will make my batter better.”

So she bought some better butter
Better than the bitter butter,
And she put it in her batter
And her batter was not bitter,
So ’twas better Betty Botter
Bought a bit of better butter
